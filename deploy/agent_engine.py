"""Deploy Cassandra to Vertex AI Agent Engine (primary runtime, ARCHITECTURE.md S5).

SPIKE-RECONCILE: confirm the Agent Engine deploy API for the pinned vertexai /
google-adk SDK. If Agent Engine deploy is flaky during submission week, the
documented fallback is to host SupervisionPipeline behind a Cloud Run service and
keep the Cloud Scheduler -> trace_poller path (risk R2).

Usage:
    python -m deploy.agent_engine
