"""Adversarial testing / red-team runner (Killer Addition).

The synthesized dataset is a static suite scored inside Phoenix. This goes
further: it actively fires those adversarial probes at the LIVE Patient under
both the current and candidate prompts, so the demo shows real attack traffic
being defeated - not just an offline pass-rate number.
